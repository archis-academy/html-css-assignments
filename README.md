<h3>HTML/CSS ASSIGNMENTS</h3>


**Landing Page**

A landing page is another good project you can make using HTML and CSS but it requires a solid knowledge of these two building blocks. You will be using lots of creativity while making a landing page. You will practice how to add footer and header, create columns, align-items, divide the sections and a lot of things. You will have to use CSS carefully keeping in mind that different elements do not overlap with each other. You will also take care of color combinations, padding, margin, space between sections, paragraphs, and boxes.
